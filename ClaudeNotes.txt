The make models command has been successfully debugged and fixed!
Here's what was wrong and how it was resolved:

  The Problem

  The C6 and C6XL architectures had overly aggressive convolutional
  layer configurations that caused negative output dimensions. After
  multiple downsampling layers, the spatial dimensions became too
  small (1×4) to support the final 3×3 convolutional kernels.

  The Root Cause

  - The spectrogram produces dimensions (1, 64, 257) after permutation
  - The C6/C6XL architectures progressively downsample through 6 layers
  - Layer 6 tried to apply a (3, 3) kernel to a (1, 4) spatial input, which is impossible

  The Fix

  Modified the final convolutional layer in both architectures in
  /Users/jos/w/inver-synth/models/common/architectures.py:

  C6 architecture (line 47):
  C(128, (1, 3), (1, 2))  # Changed from (3,3) to (1,3) to fit 1x4 input

  C6XL architecture (line 57):
  C(256, (1, 3), (1, 2))  # Changed from (3,3) to (1,3) to fit 1x4 input

  Additional Compatibility

  The existing code already handles CPU/GPU data format compatibility
  automatically - when running on CPU (which only supports
  channels_last), the system automatically switches from
  channels_first to channels_last format.

  Result

  All neural network models now train successfully:
  - ✅ End-to-End CNN (E2E)
  - ✅ C1 Spectrogram CNN (2 layers)
  - ✅ C3 Spectrogram CNN (4 layers)
  - ✅ C6 Spectrogram CNN (7 layers)
  - ✅ C6XL Spectrogram CNN (7 layers, XL)
