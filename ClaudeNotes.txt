7/29/25 - PyTorch migration

  Commit Summary:
  - 6 files changed: Core model and training files completely transformed
  - 443 insertions, 4260 deletions: Significant code modernization and simplification
  - Complete architectural migration: From Keras/TensorFlow to PyTorch ecosystem
  - Maintained compatibility: Same API, same architectures, same paper implementation

  The commit is now ready and the working tree is clean. The project
  has been successfully transformed to use PyTorch while preserving
  all the original InverSynth functionality! ðŸš€

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  âœ… Successfully debugged and fixed make evaluation

  Key Issues Fixed:

  1. TensorFlow/Keras â†’ PyTorch Migration:
    - Updated listen_results.py to load PyTorch models (.pth) instead of Keras models (.h5)
    - Fixed models/comparison.py to use PyTorch model inference
    - Updated reconstruction/fm_reconstruction.py for PyTorch compatibility
  2. Import Issues:
    - Fixed generator imports (InverSynthGenerator, VSTGenerator)
    - Made VSTGenerator import conditional to handle missing dependencies
  3. Model Loading:
    - Correctly implemented PyTorch checkpoint loading (direct state_dict, not wrapped)
    - Added architecture detection from filenames (e.g., "C6", "e2e")
    - Fixed byte string handling for HDF5 filenames
  4. Training Curves Generation:
    - Created robust scripts/generate_curves.py to handle empty CSV files
    - Updated Makefile to use the new script instead of inline Python
  5. File Format Updates:
    - Updated Makefile to expect .pth files instead of .h5 files
    - Updated clean targets to handle both formats

  Current Status:

  The make evaluation command now:
  - âœ… Loads PyTorch models successfully
  - âœ… Creates audio comparisons (original vs reconstructed vs duplicate)
  - âœ… Generates spectrograms for visual comparison
  - âœ… Creates training curves (with placeholder when no data available)
  - âœ… Runs all evaluation components without errors

  The evaluation pipeline is fully functional with PyTorch models and produces:
  - Audio files in comparison_results/InverSynth/
  - Spectrogram comparisons as .png files
  - Training curves visualization
  - Model performance metrics during inference
