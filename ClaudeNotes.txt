7/29/25 - PyTorch migration

  Commit Summary:
  - 6 files changed: Core model and training files completely transformed
  - 443 insertions, 4260 deletions: Significant code modernization and simplification
  - Complete architectural migration: From Keras/TensorFlow to PyTorch ecosystem
  - Maintained compatibility: Same API, same architectures, same paper implementation

  The commit is now ready and the working tree is clean. The project
  has been successfully transformed to use PyTorch while preserving
  all the original InverSynth functionality! üöÄ

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ‚úÖ Successfully debugged and fixed make evaluation

  Key Issues Fixed:

  1. TensorFlow/Keras ‚Üí PyTorch Migration:
    - Updated listen_results.py to load PyTorch models (.pth) instead of Keras models (.h5)
    - Fixed models/comparison.py to use PyTorch model inference
    - Updated reconstruction/fm_reconstruction.py for PyTorch compatibility
  2. Import Issues:
    - Fixed generator imports (InverSynthGenerator, VSTGenerator)
    - Made VSTGenerator import conditional to handle missing dependencies
  3. Model Loading:
    - Correctly implemented PyTorch checkpoint loading (direct state_dict, not wrapped)
    - Added architecture detection from filenames (e.g., "C6", "e2e")
    - Fixed byte string handling for HDF5 filenames
  4. Training Curves Generation:
    - Created robust scripts/generate_curves.py to handle empty CSV files
    - Updated Makefile to use the new script instead of inline Python
  5. File Format Updates:
    - Updated Makefile to expect .pth files instead of .h5 files
    - Updated clean targets to handle both formats

  Current Status:

  The make evaluation command now:
  - ‚úÖ Loads PyTorch models successfully
  - ‚úÖ Creates audio comparisons (original vs reconstructed vs duplicate)
  - ‚úÖ Generates spectrograms for visual comparison
  - ‚úÖ Creates training curves (with placeholder when no data available)
  - ‚úÖ Runs all evaluation components without errors

  The evaluation pipeline is fully functional with PyTorch models and produces:
  - Audio files in comparison_results/InverSynth/
  - Spectrogram comparisons as .png files
  - Training curves visualization
  - Model performance metrics during inference

> In @comparison_results/ what are the _copy and _duplicate suffixes?
> I assume _reconstruct denotes the synthesis from model output.

Here's what each audio file type represents in the evaluation results:

  Audio File Types Explained

  _copy.wav - Original Audio
  - This is a direct copy of the original audio file from the dataset
  - Used as the ground truth reference for comparison
  - Generated by: write_wav(copy_file, sample_rate, data) (lines 50)

  _duplicate.wav - Reference Synthesis
  - This is audio synthesized using the original known parameters from the dataset
  - It validates that the synthesis process works correctly
  - Should sound identical (or very close) to the _copy.wav file
  - Generated by: generator.generate(orig, regen_file, length, sample_rate, extra) (line 54)
  - Purpose: Confirms the synthesis pipeline is working correctly

  _reconstruct.wav - Model Prediction Synthesis ‚úÖ
  - This is audio synthesized using the parameters predicted by the neural network
  - The model analyzes the original audio and predicts what synthesis parameters would recreate it
  - Generated by: generator.generate(predicted, reconstruct_file, length, sample_rate, extra) (line 66)
  - Purpose: Shows how well the model can reverse-engineer synthesis parameters from audio

  Evaluation Workflow

  1. Original (_copy.wav) ‚Üê Ground truth audio
  2. Duplicate (_duplicate.wav) ‚Üê Synthesized from known parameters (reference)
  3. Reconstruct (_reconstruct.wav) ‚Üê Synthesized from model-predicted parameters

  You're absolutely correct that _reconstruct represents the synthesis
  from model output! This three-way comparison allows you to:

  - Compare how close the model's predictions come to the original
  - Verify the synthesis pipeline works (duplicate should ‚âà original)
  - Evaluate the neural network's parameter prediction accuracy

  The spectrograms (.png files) provide visual comparisons of the
  frequency content over time for these audio comparisons.

‚è∫ Migration Complete! üéâ

  Successfully migrated from Poetry to uv. Here's what was accomplished:

  ‚úÖ Changes Made:
  - Updated pyproject.toml to use PEP 621 standard project metadata
  - Converted Poetry dependencies to standard format
  - Added hatch build configuration for proper packaging
  - Created uv.lock file with resolved dependencies
  - Updated all commands in CLAUDE.md to use uv run
  - Removed old poetry.lock and requirements.txt files

  ‚úÖ Key Benefits:
  - Much faster installs: Dependencies resolved in 1.65s vs much longer with Poetry
  - Cleaner setup: Single uv sync --extra dev command instead of Poetry + conda hybrid
  - Better dependency resolution: uv's resolver is more reliable
  - Future-proof: Uses modern Python packaging standards

  ‚úÖ New Workflow:
  - Setup: uv sync --extra dev
  - Run tasks: uv run task test, uv run task clean, etc.
  - Run Python modules: uv run python -m models.e2e_cnn

  All tests pass and the development tools work perfectly!
